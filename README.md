## Key Findings
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Through VADER sentiment analysis and K-Means clustering, we categorized sentiments of Reddit posts, providing insights into consumer attitudes.
- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):** LDA models identified predominant themes in discussions, highlighting shifts in online vs. in-store shopping preferences.
- **Logistic Regression Analysis:** Logistic regression was used to predict sentiment based on various factors, shedding light on what influences consumer sentiment.
- **Causal Inference:** The causalml library estimated the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of the pandemic period on sentiment, showing a slight decrease in positive sentiment post-pandemic.

## Data Retrieval & Preprocessing
Data collection and preprocessing involved merging Reddit threads, tokenization, lemmatization, POS tagging, N-Gram modeling, and TF-IDF application for word significance evaluation.

## Expected Impact
The analysis provides valuable insights for businesses, economists, and policymakers by revealing changes in consumer sentiment towards Black Friday, aiding in strategic decision-making to adapt to consumer preferences and behaviors.
